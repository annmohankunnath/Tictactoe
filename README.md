This file has the Python code for a 2 player Tic Tac Toe Game

At the beginning of the game, the first player gets to choose if he wants to be 'X' or 'O' and the second player is assigned the other one. Which player gets to go first is randomly decided by the game. The game asks the players if they are ready to play,and once they type in 'y', the game begins.

The player who gets his marker across all cells in either of the rows, columns or diagonals gets to win the game. If neither player has managed to win when the board gets full, then the game is a draw. After each game, the players are asked if they want to continue and play again.
